MATLAB's search path must include the folders "experiments" and "matlab" and all their subfolders.
Our MATLAB functions assume that "matlab" is the current folder.
Our MATLAB functions will work with MATLAB 2020b.

The MATLAB files are distributed under a CC-BY-SA licence. 
They are part of a library developed by CCKM at UmU.
You use them at your own risk.
