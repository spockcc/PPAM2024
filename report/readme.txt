MATLAB's search path must include the folders "experiments" and "matlab" and all their subfolders.
Our MATLAB functions assume that "matlab" is the current folder.
Our MATLAB functions will work with MATLAB 2020b.

The files in the matlab folder are extracted from a library written by CCKM at UmU.
You are free to use them at your own risk.
